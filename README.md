# US National Parks Biodiversity
This repository is created for purposes of Data Science career path at codecademy to showcase Seaborn/matplotlib skills. To see graphs, run *main.py*. This data isn't meaningful, it was generated randomly. 

Please note, that in order to run it, you must have *observation.csv* and *species_info.csv* files in the same directory as *main.py*. You can generate merged csv of both files if you uncomment `merged.to_csv('merged.csv')` line.
